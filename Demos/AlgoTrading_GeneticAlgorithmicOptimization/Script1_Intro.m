%% Algorithmic Trading with MATLAB: Preliminary modeling
% This demo is an introduction to using MATLAB to develop a simple trading
% strategy using an exponential moving average.

%% Load in some data (Excel)
% LCO is Brent Crude blend, one of the most commonly traded oil benchmarks.
% Here, we load in price information from August 2003 through March 2011.
LCOClose = Importfile_LCOBrentCrudeOil('Data_LCO_BrentCrudeOil.xlsx');

%% Develop a simple lead/lag technical indicator
% We'll use two exponentially weighted moving averages
[Lead, Lag] = movavg(LCOClose, 5, 20,'e');

% We can interactively create the chart we want with MATLAB's plotting
% tools, and we can automatically generate code for this cart as well.
indicatorChartMA([LCOClose, Lead, Lag])

%% Develop a preliminary strategy based on the indicator 
% We will create a simple trading rule based on the moving averages'
% crossover.
signal = zeros(size(LCOClose));
signal(Lead > Lag) =  1;                        % Buy  (long)
signal(Lead < Lag) = -1;                        % Sell (short)

trades  = [0; 0; diff(signal(1:end-1))];       % shift trading by 1 period
cash    = cumsum(-trades.*LCOClose);
pnl     = [0; signal(1:end-1)].*LCOClose + cash;
returns = diff(pnl);

annualScaling = sqrt(250);                    
sharpeRatio   = annualScaling*sharpe(returns,0); % Annual Sharpe ratio

% Again, we can use MATLAB's plotting tools to provide a custom chart
% providing the information we need.
