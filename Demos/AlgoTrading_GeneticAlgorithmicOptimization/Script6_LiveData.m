%% Algorithmic Trading with MATLAB: Rule Selection
% Previously, we developed a back testing framework to calibrate a simple
% trading strategy to intraday data.  In this demo we'll use extend the
% approach to three signals: MA, RSI, and Williams %R.

%% Load data
step = 153; % minute intervals
annualScaling = sqrt(250*60*7/step);

cost = 0.01;

% Rather than forcing the customer to define and populate a database, we
% will instead read from a prepared data file.  If you wish, you may write
% the data from this file to a database of your choosing and adapt the
% GETMINUTEDATAFROMDB command to connect to and read from it.

% LCO = getMinuteDataFromDB('LCO');
c    = yahoo;
Data = fetch(c,'CSCO',{'High','Low','Adj Close'},now-5*252,now,'d');
Dates = flipud(datetime(Data(:,1),'ConvertFrom','datenum'));
Prices = flipud(Data(:,2:end));

% load oilData
% LCO = double(brent);
% clearvars -except LCO step annualScaling cost

% Prices = dsample(Prices(:,2:4), step);

%% Williams %R
% By adapting the existing moving average strategy's code, we can make
% other trading strategies based on, for example, the Relative Strength
% Index and Williams %R.  The key here is re-use: we only need to change a
% few lines of code to change from one strategy to the next.  We can take a
% look at this indicator with, say, a 50-day window:
w = willpctr(Prices, 50);

indicatorChartWPR(w)

%% Williams %R trading strategy
% Generate a trading signal each time we cross certain thresholds (up is a
% buy, down is a sell).  We will set our trading thresholds at -20% and
% -80% and vary only the size of the window, but of course we can have all
% three of these be free parameters.
wpr(Prices,50,annualScaling,cost)

%% WPR performance
% There is no reason to prefer the window parameter of 50 over other
% possibilities; let us sweep across many values to identify the optimal
% parameter setting.
range = {4:4:500};
wfun = @(x) wprFun(x,Prices,annualScaling,cost);

tic
[maxSharpe,param,sh] = parameterSweep(wfun,range);
toc

wpr(Prices,param,annualScaling,cost)

%% Generate trading signals
% We will now generate three distinct trading signals based on a moving
% average, the Williams %R described above, and a Relative Strength Index.
% The parameters for each model have already been determined independently;
% we could just as easily determine the optimal set of parameters as an
% ensemble, if we wish.
%N = 25; M = 650; thresh = 80; P = 400; Q = 34; R = 10;
N = 1; M = 129; P = 22; Q = 14; R = 24; thresh = 80;
sma = leadlag(Prices(:,end), N, M, annualScaling, cost);
srs = rsi(Prices(:,end), [P Q], thresh, annualScaling, cost);
swr = wpr(Prices, param, annualScaling, cost);

signals = [sma srs swr];
names = {'MA','RSI','WPR'};

%% Trading signals
% Plot the 'state' of the market represented by the signals.  On the bottom
% plot, green is a long position and red is a short position.

indicatorChartALL(Prices(:,end), names, signals)

%% Generate initial population for Genetic Algorithm
% Generate initial population for signals
I = size(signals,2);
pop = initializePopulation(I);

close all
plotRules(1,pop);

% Objective function definition
obj = @(pop) fitness(pop,signals,Prices(:,end),annualScaling,cost);

%% Solve With Genetic Algorithm
% Find best trading rule and maximum Sharpe ratio (min -Sharpe ratio)
options = gaoptimset('PopulationType','bitstring',...

% Evaluate the objective at the best value, and flip the sign convention
% for the optimal Sharpe ratio.
