%% Algorithmic Trading with MATLAB: Intraday trading
% This demo expands on the previous demo to incorporate a larger, intraday
% trading set (loaded from a database).  More data implies more
% calculations, so we use Parallel Computing Toolbox to accelerate the
% analysis.

%% Load intraday data from a database
% Our large, intraday data set is stored in a database instead of in an
% Excel spreadsheet.  MATLAB can read in data from these data sources
% thanks to Database Toolbox.

% Rather than forcing the customer to define and populate a database, we
% will instead read from a prepared data file.  If you wish, you may write
% the data from this file to a database of your choosing and adapt the
% GETMINUTEDATAFROMDB command to connect to and read from it.

% LCO = getMinuteDataFromDB('LCO');

load oilData
LCO = double(brent);
clearvars -except LCO

LCOClose = LCO(:,4);
cost     = 0.01;     % Bid/ask spread

%% Open a parallel computing environment
% We will be performing many more backtests on a larger data set than
% before, so we would like to take advantage of as many processors as we
% can in order to speed up the computation.  MATLAB's Parallel Computing
% Toolbox makes this straightforward.  First, we open a pool of parallel
% workers:

% Use all the cores on my laptop
ResetMyCluster

% Then we use MATLAB's |parfor| construct to parallelize our |for|-loops:
edit leadlagFun

%% Perform the parameter sweep
% We will sweep not just across many combinations of leading and lagging
% averages, but we will furthermore sweep across many different
% granularities of data in an effort to find the 'best' frequency to use.
% The variable 'ts' below is the sampling time and varies from 1 minute up
% to 420 minutes (i.e.: about 1 trading day)
seq = generateSpacedInts(1, 200, 25);
ts  = generateSpacedInts(1, 420, 25);

range = {seq,seq,ts};
annualScaling = sqrt(250*7*60);
llfun =@(x) leadlagFun(x,LCOClose,annualScaling,cost);

tic
[~,param,sh,xyz] = parameterSweep(llfun,range);
toc

leadlag(LCOClose(1:param(3):end),param(1),param(2),...
        sqrt(annualScaling^2/param(3)),cost)
xlabel(['Frequency (',num2str(param(3)),' minute intervals)'])

%% Plot iso-surface
% Before, we used a surface plot to show how the Sharpe ratio depended on
% the two underlying parameters.  Now that we have three parameters, we
% will plot an iso-surface, a 3D volume plot where color indicates the
% Sharpe ratio.
