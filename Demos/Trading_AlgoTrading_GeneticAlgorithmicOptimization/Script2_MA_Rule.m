%% Algorithmic Trading with MATLAB: Moving Average Rule
% This demo is uses MATLAB to develop and test a simple trading strategy
% using an exponential moving average.

%% (Re)Load data
LCOClose      = Importfile_LCOBrentCrudeOil('Data_LCO_BrentCrudeOil.xlsx');
annualScaling = sqrt(250);

%% Using functions to automate our workflow
% The |leadlag| function copies over most of the functionality from the
% previous script and places it in a reusable format.  All we need to
% specify is the historical data, our leading and lagging day lengths, and
% our scaling parameter.
%
% We can demonstrate the use of this function by setting the leading
% average to 1 (i.e.: not an average at all) and the lagging average to,
% say, 20 days.
leadlag(LCOClose,1,20,annualScaling)

%% Performing a simple parameter sweep
% Perform a parameter sweep to identify the best lagging parameter, given a
% leading value of 1.

sharpes = nan(100,1);

for m = 1:100
    [~,~,sharpes(m)] = leadlag(LCOClose,1,m);
end

[~,mxInd] = max(sharpes);
leadlag(LCOClose,1,mxInd,annualScaling)

%% Estimate parameters over a range of values
% Allows both moving average lengths to vary and identify the best combo.
sharpes = nan(100,100);

tic
for n = 1:100  
    for m = n:100
        [~,~,sharpes(n,m)] = leadlag(LCOClose,n,m,annualScaling);
    end
end
toc

% We can again use plotting tools to create a custom plot.  In this case,
% we show the Sharpe ratio as a function of both the leading and lagging
% days.  MATLAB can easily deplay 3D data like this using surface and
% contour plots.
sweepPlotMA(sharpes)

%% Plot best Sharpe ratio
[~, bestInd] = max(sharpes(:)); % (Linear) location of max value
[bestM, bestN] = ind2sub(100, bestInd); % Lead and lag at best value

leadlag(LCOClose, bestM, bestN,annualScaling)

%% More automation and more real-world considerations
% Next, we'll add the trading costs associated with the bid/ask spread.
% This will get us closer to the actual profit we could expect.  As an
% exercise, you should extend this to account for additional trading costs
% and slippage considerations.
%
% Note also that we have automated our parameter sweep process.  Just as
% before, when we adapted our script into the |leadlag| function, we are
% now taking the double-|for| loop above and turning it into its own
% function.

cost  = 0.05;           % Bid/ask spread
range = {1:120, 1:120}; % Leading and lagging average parameter ranges
llfun = @(x) leadlagFun(x, LCOClose, annualScaling, cost);

tic
[maxSharpe, param, sh, vars] = parameterSweep(llfun, range);
